# Development Guide

Ready to contribute to the Quantum Compilation Suite of the MQSS? This guide will help you get
started.

## Development Environment

- It is recommended to use a docker container to ensure consistent, stable development environment.
- The required `DockerFile` and `devcontainer.json` are provided in `.devcontainer` directory. Build
  and RUN the docker container using the following commands:

```sh
docker build -t mqss-pass-dev -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile .
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$PWD":/workspaces/MQSS-Quantum-Compilation-Suite \
  -w /workspaces/MQSS-Quantum-Compilation-Suite \
  mqss-pass-dev \
  bash
```

## Building the tool

- The driver is the `Makefile` within the project root.
- The Makefile invokes build scripts within `scripts/`. `build.sh`: Main script for configuring the
  build for all targets including `mqss-opt`

- The ``make` commands to build the targets remain the same as in the [README](../../README.md).
  Ensure the sequence of commands is followed.

## Project structure (for Current Release)

- Dialect registration lives in `lib/Dialects`. Dialect-agnostic MLIR optimization passes (namespace
  `mqss::mqssci::opt`) live in `lib/Passes/Transforms`. Code-generation/lowering passes (namespace
  `mqss::mqssci::codegen`) live in `lib/Passes/CodeGen`. Circuit-equivalence verification (namespace
  `mqss::mqssci::verify`) lives in `lib/Passes/Verification` — see
  [Verification Infrastructure](verification.md). `lib/MQSSCIInterfaces` wraps the pass library
  behind a single-call `MQSSCompiler` API for consumers who don't need direct `mlir::OpPassManager`
  access — see [Integrating the MQSS Quantum Compilation Suite](integrate.md).

- CUDAQ and Catalyst are included as external dependencies and are downloaded and installed as
  `cmake` modules. Following targets are built for each of these modules:
  - CUDAQ: `QuakeDialect CCDialect QECDialect OptimBuilder OptCodeGen`
  - Catalyst : `MLIRMBQC MLIRQRef MLIRQuantum` These targets incorporate all dialect related headers
    and API implementations.
  - MQT-Core, MQT-QMAP, and MQT-QCEC are fetched similarly and are what the verification
    infrastructure uses to represent circuits and run equivalence checks.

## CMakeLists.txt

The pass library is built as one CMake target per directory under `lib/`, each with its own
`CMakeLists.txt` declaring exactly the external dependencies (CUDAQ, Catalyst, QDMI, MQT-Core,
MQT-QMAP, MQT-QCEC, MLIR conversion libraries, etc.) that its own sources actually need:

- `lib/Dialects/CMakeLists.txt` — builds `MQSSSupportedDialects` (dialect registration).
- `lib/Passes/CodeGen/CMakeLists.txt` — builds `MQSSCICodeGenPasses` (code-generation/lowering
  passes), linking `MQSSSupportedDialects` `PUBLIC`.
- `lib/Passes/Transforms/CMakeLists.txt` — builds `MQSSCITransformPasses` (dialect-agnostic
  optimization passes), linking `MQSSCICodeGenPasses` `PUBLIC`.
- `lib/Passes/Verification/CMakeLists.txt` — builds `MQSSCIVerificationPasses` (equivalence-checking
  instrumentation, see [Verification Infrastructure](verification.md)), linking
  `MQSSSupportedDialects`, `MQT::CoreIR`, and `MQT::QCEC` `PUBLIC`.
- `lib/MQSSCIInterfaces/CMakeLists.txt` — builds `MQSSCIInterfaces` (the `MQSSCompiler` library
  API), linking `MQSSCITransformPasses` and `MQSSCIVerificationPasses` `PUBLIC`. Exposed to external
  consumers as the `mqss-ci::mqss-ci` alias (see [Integrate](integrate.md)).

Note: `MQSSCITransformPasses` and `MQSSCIVerificationPasses` are built as plain static libraries (no
`SHARED` keyword). `add_mlir_library` builds a static library in two pieces — an `obj.<name>` object
library that does the actual compiling, and a `<name>` static archive that just packages its
already- compiled objects — so `target_compile_options`/`target_compile_definitions` calls must
target `obj.<name>` (guarded by `if(TARGET obj.<name>)`) to actually affect compilation; targeting
`<name>` alone silently does nothing. See
[Verification Infrastructure](verification.md#a-cmake-pitfall-specific-to-this-library) for a worked
example of this pitfall. Relatedly, these two libraries used to be built `SHARED`; they were
switched to static because two `SHARED` libraries that both statically link overlapping LLVM
component libraries (as these do, transitively through `MLIRPass`/`MLIRTransforms`) each end up with
their own private copy of LLVM's global command-line option registry, which crashes at runtime with
an "option registered more than once" error the moment both are loaded into the same process.

Because each dependency is declared `PUBLIC` at the target that actually needs it, everything
propagates transitively up the chain. `root/CMakeLists.txt` only has to link the final executable
against the top of that chain plus MLIR's own driver library:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(mqss-opt PUBLIC MLIROptLib MQSSCITransformPasses MQSSCIVerificationPasses)
```

Note: this transitive propagation is convenient, but it isn't a substitute for checking what a given
`.cpp` file's callees actually require. If a source file (or a library it calls into, such as
`CUDAQ::CodeGen`) needs a specific MLIR conversion library, link it explicitly at the target that
contains that source file — don't assume it will arrive transitively from another target further
down the chain.

## Testing

- We use python-lit along-with ninja and FileCheck to perform dialect-level (input: MLIR dialect;
  output: MLIR dialect) and optionally end-to-end (input:c++/python code; output: MLIR dialect)
  testing. In the end, what is tested for correctness is the output optimized/transformed MLIR
  dialect. In a select few cases, especially the `CodeGen` passes, the backend exchange formats e.g.
  QIR or OpenQasm2 are tested for correctness.

- The tests can be found in directories : `tests/dialects` and `tests/code`.

- Dialect-level testing

  1. The input dialect is annotated with the RUN command, for e.g.:

  `// RUN: %mqss-opt %s --CommonCommutePass=mode=CX-X 2>&1 | FileCheck %s` which runs the
  target/executable `mqss-opt` along-with the pass `CommonCommutePass`. FileCheck looks for strings
  to match, specified using the `CHECK:` keyword, for e.g.

  ```sh
  // CHECK: %out_qubits = quantum.custom "PauliX"() %2 : !quantum.bit
  // CHECK: %out_qubits_0:2 = quantum.custom "CNOT"() %1, %2 : !quantum.bit, !quantum.bit
  ```

  If an exact match is found in the output dialect, the test succeeds, otherwise the test fails.

  1. End-to-End testing (Optional) In this testing, the input is a c++/python code, which is then
     translated to the input MLIR dialect. The testing then proceeds as in (1). The emphasis here is
     on testing the front-end translation pipeline as well as the transformed dialects. A wrapper
     script `mqss-cc` is used to invoke the necessary tools to translate the c++/python code to the
     input quake or catalyst-quantum dialect. If the input code to MLIR dialect translation fails,
     then the test itself will fail. An example test file performing such a test is shown below:

     ```sh
      // RUN: %mqss-cc %S/../CommuteCNotRxPass.cpp --passes=CommonCommutePass=mode=CX-RX | FileCheck %s

      // CHECK: quake.rx (%cst_1) %4 : (f64, !quake.ref) -> ()
      // CHECK-NEXT: quake.x [%1] %2 : (!quake.ref, !quake.ref) -> ()
     ```

  The test proceeds as follows:

  1. mqss-cc parses the command-line arguments
     `%S/../CommuteCNotRxPass.cpp --passes=CommonCommutePass=mode=CX-RX`
  2. Since, a c++ code is the input, it is assumed that the code contains a quantum circuit defined
     using cudaq (will be updated in the future).
  3. The c++ to quake dialect translation pipeline is invoked via the tool `cudaq-quake`
  4. Once the input dialect is generated, `mqss-opt` tool is used to apply MQSS
     optimization/translation passes defined using the `--passes` flag.
  5. Finally, the optimized/transformed dialect is emitted which is checked by FileCheck.

  Note: Make sure that the path to `cudaq-quake` and `mqss-opt` are appended to the `$PATH`
  environment variable of your shell via the command : `eval "$(make set-target-paths)"`.

## Verification

Circuit-equivalence verification is implemented as an `mlir::PassInstrumentation` rather than an
ordinary pass — see [Verification Infrastructure](verification.md) for the implementation details,
including a CMake pitfall specific to its static library target that's easy to repeat when adding
new compile options elsewhere in the project.

## Enabling Pass Debug Information

The Pass debug information can be enabled by passing in the flag `--debug` to the `DEBUG_FLAG`
variable within the Makefile. Simply remove the flag if no debug information is needed.
